<b>1. What is the primary function of the website?<br/></b>

Our website connects users with relevant connections based on the category of their topic. By defining the category hierarchy and providing additional focal parameters surrounding their topic, users can receive a detailed breakdown tailored to their needs.<br/><br/>



<b>2. How do I start using the website?</b>
<br/>


Simply enter your topic, define the category it falls under, specify the hierarchy of these categories, and provide any additional focal parameters. Our engine will then provide a breakdown according to your input.
<br/>
<br/>


<b>3. What are "focal parameters"?</b>
<br/>

Focal parameters are additional criteria or attributes that surround your topic. They help narrow down and refine the connections to be more relevant to your specific requirements or interests.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>4. Why do I need to define a category hierarchy?</b>
<br/>

Defining a category hierarchy helps in structuring the connections more efficiently. It ensures that the breakdown presented aligns with the levels of specificity or generalization you're interested in.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>5. Can I modify the category hierarchy after getting the results?</b>
<br/>

Yes, you can adjust the category hierarchy and refine your search to get different breakdowns based on your evolving needs.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>6. How accurate are the connections provided?</b>
<br/>

Our engine uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure that the connections are relevant to the topic, category, hierarchy, and focal parameters you define. However, the accuracy also depends on how well you define these criteria.
